Password Strength Checker
This is a simple password strength checker built in python. The script analyzes parameters like length of the password, number and variety of special characters in the password to evaluate the overall strength of the password. The script also checks for the password in a list of commonly used passwords, so the password created cannot be brute forced easily.
